# Approach

## Summary
1. Start with a simple HTML, CSS and JS
2. As the application grows larger, split the JS and CSS into multiple CSS and JS respectively
3. For accessing files on the local desktop, choose Electron as the local desktop provider.
4. For the JS, place set of related functions into a separate class with static methods
5. Convert the files into Typescript, so that dropdowns work well
6. Modularize the applications
